This is the final project of the course Programming 3: Interfaces and Techniques at Tampere University, which I completed in 2022. 
Most of the project was done by me, with 2 other team members contributions totalling to about 15% of the project together. The exact
work division is detailed in the documentation file.
While the project is far from polished, and I didnâ€™t have time to finish every feature we planned for, 
I still feel its a decent show of skills, and was definitely a learning experience.

The project was about creating a study planner that imports the degree structures of study programmes in Tampere University from the Sisu API. 
The learning outcomes were to practice object-oriented programming, using external libraries and API:s, implementing a GUI and working on a program as a team. 

The most important files are KoriAPIGetter.java and Sisu.java, the rest are mostly just replicating the API:s tree hierarchy we had no control over.
